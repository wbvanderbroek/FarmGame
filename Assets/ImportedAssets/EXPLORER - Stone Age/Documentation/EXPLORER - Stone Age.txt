Thank you for purchasing EXPLORER - Stone Age!

Here are a few tips to help you build amazing things quicker:

Characters:

	There are 2 genders for characters, each gender having multiple skin tones and clothing items.
	There are numerous customization possibilities, all the items are contained in a "master" model,
	in order to access them, open the model's hierarchy and activate or deactivate items as you please.
	Some prefabs are already customized, to showcase part of the available variety.
	Animations are provided with the package, just drag & drop a controller from the animations folder
	and see them in action. Also, the characters are compatible with Mixamo animations.

Models:

	All models have a pretty low triangle count, but there are some where further simplification was
	possible, so there's a mobile version in the Prefabs folders.
	Models with more complex shapes have a custom mesh collider.

Scripts:

	A prop movement and rotation script was added, it comes in handy when trying to rotate or trenslate an object.

Shaders:

	2 custom shaders have been included in the package, one is for the stylized water and the other one is used on
	objects that would be affected by wind. The wind animated vertex shader uses the vertex color information of the
	model, in order to detect which area is affected by wind.

Post Processing:

	A wide array of post processing and LUT textures has been included in the package. It's very easy to create night
	and day, rainy or sunny scenes.

Particles:

	A collection of particles has been included too, from dragonfly swarms to rain and sandstorm effects.

Skyboxes:

	A large variation of hand-painted skyboxes is also included, ranging from sunny desert, to starry night.
